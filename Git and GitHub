###Git and Github:
###Git :
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that tracks changes in source code during software development.  It allows developers to manage code history, work on features in isolation using branches, and collaborate efficiently without overwriting each other’s work.

###Github:
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories, enabling collaboration, code sharing, and project management.  It provides tools like pull requests, code reviews, issues, and GitHub Actions for automation

|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|         **Git**           |                  A free and open-source version control system used to track changes in code across time.                       |
|   **Version Control**     |           A method for programmers to save versions of code, track changes, revert to previous states, and debug.               |
|  **Repository (Repo)**    |                       A folder or directory where project files are stored and tracked by Git.                                  |
|       **GitHub**          |          An online platform to host Git repositories, enabling collaboration, portfolio display, and remote access .            |
|    **Terminal/CLI**       |            A command-line interface to interact with the system and Git using text commands instead of GUI.                     |
|      **Branch**           |   A separate line of development within a Git repository, allowing independent changes without affecting the main codebase.     |
|   **Master Branch**       |              The default or main branch in a Git repository, typically containing the stable version of code.                   |
|       **Fork**            |    A complete copy of a repository, typically used to propose changes to someone else's code or to freely experiment.           |
|   **Pull Request (PR)**   |     A request to merge changes from one branch or fork into another branch in a repository, often involving code review.        |

### Git Basic Commands Covered

|      Command       |                                        Purpose                                                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `git clone`        |              Downloads a repository from GitHub (remote) to local machine.                      |             
| `git add`          |              Stages changes (new/modified files) to prepare them for commit.                    |            
| `git commit -m`    |         Saves staged changes to the local Git repository with a descriptive message.            |      
| `git push`         |         Uploads committed changes from local repo to remote repository (e.g., GitHub).          |     
| `git pull`         |             Fetches and merges changes from remote repository to local repo.                    |        
| `git status`       |      Displays the status of files—modified, staged, untracked—in the working directory.         |
| `git branch`       |              Lists branches or creates a new branch when used with options.                     |       
| `git checkout`     |             Switches between branches or creates new branches (`-b` option).                    |     
| `git merge`        |                 Combines changes from one branch into another locally.                          |        
| `git diff`         |              Shows differences between commits, branches, or working files.                     |    
| `git reset`        |   Unstages files or can undo commits depending on options used (`--hard` for full rollback).    |

### Workflow Overview

- **Working via GitHub Web Interface:**
  - Create or edit files directly on GitHub.
  - Commit changes immediately (GitHub handles staging).
  - No need to push changes since edits are live on the remote repo.
  - Good for quick edits or small projects.

- **Working Locally Using Git:**
  - Clone the remote repository to local machine.
  - Make changes in local code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
  - Use `git add` to stage changes.
  - Use `git commit` to save changes locally.
  - Use `git push` to upload changes to remote repository.
  - Pull remote changes with `git pull`.
  - Useful for larger projects or when offline work is needed.

---

### Branching and Merging

- **Branches** allow multiple lines of development to coexist independently.
- The **master branch** is the main branch, where stable code lives.
- Creating a **feature branch** lets you develop new features or fixes without affecting master.
- Changes committed on one branch are isolated from others until merged.
- Common practice:
  - Create feature branches for new work.
  - Commit changes on feature branches.
  - Push feature branches to GitHub.
  - Open a **pull request** to merge changes into master.
  - Review and merge pull requests.
  - Delete feature branches after merging.

---

### Pull Requests (PR)

- A **PR** is a formal request to merge one branch into another (typically feature branch into master).
- PRs enable code review, discussion, and approval before merging.
- Additional commits can be pushed to the branch while a PR is open.
- Reviewers can comment on specific lines of code.
- PRs help maintain code quality and collaboration standards.

---

### Handling Merge Conflicts

- Conflicts occur when changes on different branches affect the same lines of code.
- Git cannot automatically merge and requires manual resolution.
- Conflict markers in files indicate the conflicting sections.
- Conflicts can be resolved using:
  - The GitHub web interface.
  - Code editors (e.g., Visual Studio Code offers tools to accept changes).
  - Manual editing in the terminal or editor.
- After resolving conflicts, a commit is necessary to finalize the merge.

---

### Undoing Changes

- `git reset` can be used to unstage files or undo commits.
- `git reset HEAD^` moves the HEAD pointer to a previous commit, undoing the latest commit.
- Using `git reset --hard` discards all changes after a specific commit permanently.
- Viewing commit history with `git log` helps identify which commits to undo.
- Good commit messages are essential for clarity when reviewing history.

---

### SSH Keys and Authentication

- To push or pull from GitHub securely, SSH keys are used for authentication.
- SSH keys consist of:
  - A **private key** stored securely on the local machine.
  - A **public key** uploaded to GitHub.
- SSH key pairs provide a cryptographically secure way to prove ownership of the GitHub account.
- Steps include:
  - Generate SSH key pair with `ssh-keygen`.
  - Upload the public key (`*.pub` file) to GitHub under account settings.
  - Configure local SSH agent to use the key.
- SSH setup varies slightly by operating system but follows similar principles.

---

### Forking and Contributions to External Repositories

- **Forking** creates a personal copy of someone else’s repository on GitHub.
- Ideal for contributing to projects you do not have write access to.
- Workflow:
  - Fork the repository.
  - Clone your fork locally.
  - Create branches, make changes, and push to your fork.
  - Submit a pull request from your fork to the original repository.
- Forks retain all branches from the original repository.
- Common practice in open source to manage contributions.

---

### GitHub Branching Strategies in Larger Projects

- Larger projects often use multiple long-lived branches, e.g., `master`, `dev`, `staging`.
- Feature branches are merged into `dev` or `staging` rather than directly into `master`.
- `dev` and `master` branches are protected and not directly edited.
- After testing on `dev`, changes are merged into `master` for release.
- Temporary branches are deleted post-merge to keep repository clean.

---

### Practical Tools Mentioned

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):**
  - A popular free code editor with Git integration.
  - Allows terminal access inside the editor.
  - Provides visual cues for modified files and conflict resolution.
- **Terminal/Command Line:**
  - Essential for learning Git commands and workflows.
  - Provides flexibility and control over Git operations.
- **Git Bash (Windows):**
  - Recommended terminal emulator for Windows users to run Git commands more smoothly.

---

### Important Best Practices Highlighted

- Write meaningful commit messages to clarify changes.
- Use descriptive branch names reflecting the feature or fix.
- Regularly sync feature branches with master to avoid conflicts.
- Review pull requests carefully before merging.
- Delete branches after merging to maintain repository hygiene.
- Use the terminal frequently to become comfortable with Git.
